From a very young age he has been interested in history and the origin of his family, and with it came a fascination for the cultural and architectural heritage of the region that is currently Poland. After his graduation in law at Leiden University he got involved in various Dutch organisations concerning the preservation of and information about old country houses, estates and the families who lived in it. It makes me very happy to witness the rise of such an organisation in Poland; a land that is so rich in cultural and architectural heritage. I very much hope that through New Heritage Poland I can make a contribution to the much needed preservation of that valuable heritage."

Among these pages are the stories of many buildings, some thought lost to fire, or ignorance and decay whose history has been recovered and subsequently recreated. Through paint analysis and the application of 30 years experience in historic interiors, Patrick is able to paint a picture of the past"
